We have recreated the work of https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.4791. The objective is to recognize spurious and missing links from a Network. We do that by following an statistical model where it is assumed that all the netwroks are block stochastic
networks. The main issue to solve is how to compute the sum over all the possible configurations (or commpute the partition function). To do that we use the Metropolis algorithm.
